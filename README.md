# Text Editor

  
## As a developer, I want to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection so that I can reliably retrieve them for later use. In this project, I need to create a Text Editor that satisfies the following criteria: 
  1. When I open my application in my editor, then I should see a client server folder structure.
  2. When I run `npm run start` from the root directory, then I should find that my application should start up the backend and serve the client.
  3. When I run the text editor application from my terminal, then I should find that my JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack.
  4. When I run my webpack plugins, then I should find that I have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file.
  5. When I use next-gen JavaScript in my application, then I should find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors.
  6. When I open the text editor, then I should find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage.
  7. When I enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window, then I should find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB.
  8. When I reopen the text editor after closing it, then I should find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB.
  9. When I click on the Install button, then I should download my web application as an icon on my desktop.
  10. When I load my web application, then I should have a registered service worker using workbox.
  11. When I register a service worker, then I should have my static assets pre cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets.
  12. When I deploy to Heroku, then I should have proper build scripts for a webpack application.
